A Pure native Swift Postgresql client library 

The goal of this library was to have a pure native Swift postgres client library without depending on libpq.

I tried to implement frontend/backend postgres protocol ( https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/protocol.html )

Auth+paramenter binding weren't complete yet. Open sourcing for learning purposes though its very ugly. Disconintuining this effort since [SwiftPQ](https://github.com/goloveychuk/SwiftPQ) is further along and has more progress + cleaner than my initial efforts. Will try to contribute SwiftPQ based on my learnings here.
